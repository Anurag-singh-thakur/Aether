# Aether - Museum Branch

> **Note:** The core feature of Aether — **eye tracking and attention detection** — has never been open-sourced due to confidentiality. It will be released when Aether has matured enough to fully deliver on its vision. Without this feature, Aether is just another concept of an LMS, but with it, Aether aims to become something truly transformative for education.

## History

Welcome to the **Museum** branch of **Aether**. This branch holds the legacy code of a project that has been close to my heart since its inception. On **May 27, 2019**, this project was born out of a collaborative effort between me and my three amazing teammates: **[Shabab Rahman](https://github.com/ShababR)**, **[Mustafizur Rahaman](https://github.com/MustfizurRahaman)**, and **[Moshiur Mubin](https://github.com/moshiurmubin)**. What started as a simple idea grew into something much bigger.

Over time, as life took its course, Aether became a personal project for me. However, the original vision remains unchanged — a tool to help our education system, one that would always be **free** and **open-source**.

## Aether's Vision

Aether was designed with the belief that education should be accessible to all, and that the right tools can empower both students and educators. Although this branch is dedicated to the legacy code, it represents a foundation built on hope and hard work. The journey is far from over, and I still believe that one day, Aether will evolve into something transformative for the education system.

## Why "Museum"?

The **museum** branch serves as a preservation of our initial work, showcasing the early stages of Aether. While much of this code may no longer be used in the main project, it remains an important part of Aether's history and growth.

## Future Aspirations

Aether is not just a relic of the past. Even though it's a pet project now, I continue to nurture it, believing that it will eventually reach its full potential. This project will stay open to anyone who wishes to contribute, use, or learn from it. Together, we can make a positive impact on the education system.

Stay tuned for more updates, and feel free to explore the **museum**.
